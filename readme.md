TODO:
* Make anchor-points more flexible and robust. Right now it is easy to mess up the plot by choosing xlims that are not exactly equal to the flanking anchorpoints.
* Merge graduated scale tranformations with function-of-length scale transformations
* Plot of actual magnification
* Add a ChIP-seq example to the .rmd
